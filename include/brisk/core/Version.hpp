 * The buildInfo string is composed dynamically, depending on the system and compiler
 * used for building. It may contain details like:
 * - OS name
 * - Compiler version (Clang, MSVC, GCC)
 * - C++ standard library version
 * - Platform-specific versions (Windows, Android)
 * - Debugging and exception flags
 * - Date of build
 *
 * Example output:
 * ```
 * OS=Linux; Clang=10.0.0; GNUC=9.3.0; GLIBC=2.31; FLAGS=[D]; BUILT_ON=Sep 23 2024
